# 1.16-1.20 Client Archive

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20By%20-%20Wizard_11%20-%20purple)

This is an archive with hacked clients for the latest versions of minecraft. 

Cracked clients are marked with **[*]**

Payed clients are marked with **[$]**

After the client, I will add a number of stars to show my rating of the client. This is MY opinion, and should be taken with a grain of salt.


**Enjoy!**

## Client Archive:

> **Ares**: [Ares Client Website](https://aresclient.org/download) ★★★★ (underrated, a good client but should be paired with something else)

> **Wurst**: [Download Wurst Client 7-35-1](https://www.wurstclient.net/updates/wurst-7-35-1/) ★★★ (The client has improved, but is not good for anarchy.)

> **BleachHack**: [Bleachhack website (Use 1.0)](https://bleachhack.org/downloads.html) ★★★ (The CA is not horrible, but the client lacks features)

> **ForgeHax**: [ForgeHax](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax) ★★ (Not a bad client, but the fact that it is command based is very annoying)

> **Inertia**: [Inertia](https://inertiaclient.com/) ★★★ (Not good for cpvp, but is not a bad client in general)

> **Aristois**: [Aristois Installer](https://aristois.net/) ★★ (Lacks many features needed for anarchy)

> **Impact**: [Impact Installer](https://impactclient.net/) ★★ (Is not maintained, and lacks many features)

> **[*] Boze Crack**: [Github](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Boze) ★★ (Has some good features, but is very outdated)

> **[$] Boze Client**: [Website (18 USD)](https://boze.dev/) ★★★★★ (Amazing render modules, and solid pvp modules, when paired with a good config and blackout this client is near unstoppable)

> **[*] Bloody Crack**: [GitHub](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/BloodyClient) - (Outdated, use the V2 crack)

> **[$] Bloody Client**: [Website (20 USD)](https://bloody-client.site/) ★ (Most of the client is skidded, and the website is copied and pasted. Do not buy.)

> **[$] Future Client**: [Website (20 USD)](https://www.futureclient.net/) ★★★★★ (Known for pvp modules and some bypasses, I would say that the 1.20.4 version is worth the price)

> **Jex Client**: [Github](https://github.com/DustinRepo/JexClient) ★★ (Lacks several features, very laggy)

> **[*] Boze Crack v2**: [External Site](https://crystalpvp.ru/bozeupdate/) ★★★ (Outdated and harder to set up, but has some good modules for anarchy)

> **[*] Bloody Crack v2**: [Github](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/BLOODYCLIENT1.0.0) ★★ (Not a bad crack, but is very laggy)

> **[$] Rusherhack Client**: [Website (20 USD)](https://rusherhack.org/) ★★★★ (Nice client for render and util, some of the rewritten pvp modules work well. Use with another client.)

> **[$] Mio Client**: [Website (Invite Only, then 20 USD)](https://www.mioclient.me/) - (Known for pvp modules and render. Causes a bug with the future client.)

> **Meteor Client**: [Website](https://meteorclient.com/) / [Archive](https://github.com/ManInMyVan/meteor-archive) ★★★★★ (Amazing client, and due to the addon system can become on of the best modern client options. Would reccomend.) **Addons can be found [HERE](https://anticope.pages.dev/)**

> **Postman Client**: [Github](https://github.com/srgantmoomoo/postman?tab=readme-ov-file) - (Known for ca, never tried the client tho)

> **MatHax**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/qKDty6yzKw) ★★★★ (Crashes are frequent, but is a good client with several bypasses)

> **ThunderHack Recode**: [Github](https://github.com/Pan4ur/ThunderHack-Recode) ★★★★★ (Amazing looking client with many solid pvp and render modules. Includes some bypasses)

> **[$] Prestige**: [Website (10 Euros)](https://prestigeclient.vip/) ★★★★ (A great ghost client, not for anarchy)

> **[*] Prestige Crack**: [External Site](https://crystalpvp.ru/prestige) ★★★★ (Great crack, but can crash on windows. Possibly unsafe)

> **LiquidBounce**: [Website](https://liquidbounce.net/download) ★★★★ (Solid client with many bypasses. Not for anarchy.)

> **Lumina**: [Github](https://github.com/LuminaDevelopment/LuminaClient) ★★ (Ghost modules are easily detected.)
